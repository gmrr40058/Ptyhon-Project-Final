# Ptyhon-Project-Final
This project applies classification on a real dataset. After preprocessing steps such as cleaning and handling missing values, exploratory data analysis was performed. Five models—SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression—were used, and their performances were compared.
